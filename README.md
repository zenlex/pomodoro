FreeCodeCamp - Front End Libraries Certification Final Project - Pomodoro Timer
Written by Erich R. Keil May 2020

For this project I configured a minimal react from scratch rather than using the create-react-app template I had used for previous projects. 

I plan to construct this using vanilla React without any additional external libraries or plugins. 

For requirements of the project visit FreeCodeCamp.org and look for the Front End Libraries Certification -> Front End Libraries Projects -> Pomodoro Timer.
